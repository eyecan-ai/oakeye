--------
Features
--------

* Trinocular Camera Calibration
* Dataset Acquisition with rectified images, disparity and sensor depth.

-----
Usage
-----

All input and output datasets are stored using the **Underfolder** format.
See `Pipelime`_ for more info.

Calibration
-----------

Perform trinocular calibration with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

        oakeye trinocular calibrate -o $OUTPUT_FOLDER [OPTIONS]


Where ``OPTIONS`` include:

- ``-i, --input_folder PATH`` - Calibrate using previously saved images. If not set
  images will be acquired live with an OpenCV GUI. Press 's' to acquire an image and 'q'
  to perform calibration and exit.
- ``-b, --board_cfg PATH`` - The board configuration file. If not set, a default configuration
  located in ``oakeye/data/board/chessboard.yml`` will be used.
- ``-d, --device_cfg PATH`` - The device configuration file. If not set, a default configuration
  located in ``oakeye/data/device/device.yml`` will be used.
- ``-s, --scale_factor INTEGER`` - Preview downscale factor, defaults to ``2``.
- ``-S, --save`` - Also save acquired images in $OUTPUT_FOLDER. If not set, only the calibration
  file will be saved.

Press 's' to select the frames to perform calibration with, only if all the corners are visible in the three cameras they will be used for calibration.

Calibration results are stored in a file named ``calibration.yml`` inside ``$OUTPUT_FOLDER``.

Acquisition
-----------

Acquire images from the sensor with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

        oakeye trinocular acquire [OPTIONS]


Where ``OPTIONS`` include:

- ``--output_folder PATH`` - Save images in the specified folder.
- ``--calibration PATH`` - Calibration file computed with the ``calibration`` command. 
  If specified it will also rectify the images and compute the disparities.
- ``--device_cfg PATH`` - The device configuration file. 
- ``--scale_factor INTEGER`` - Preview downscale factor, defaults to ``2``.
- ``--max_depth INTEGER`` - Max value (mm) of the depth preview, defaults to ``1000``
- ``--max_disparity INTEGER`` - Max value of the disparities, defaults to ``64``

Press 's' to save the frames.
